The app incorporates a point-based system where users can accumulate points by sharing products, viewing advertisements, and participating in other engagement activities.

To enhance the user experience, SmartFoodInventory suggests recipes based on the available ingredients in a user's inventory. Users can discover new and creative ways to utilize their food items, reducing waste and maximizing their culinary options. Detailed recipe information, including ingredients and preparation steps, is provided to guide users through the cooking process.
